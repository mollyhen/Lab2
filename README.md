This image was generated by using a API-based crawler to collect Geo-tagged Twitter data. The specific topic I chose was fortnite, which is a battle royal style video game availble on console, PC, and phone to play for free. It is one of the most popular video games played on the market today.

The reason I chose this topic was because on the day I was working on the lab, Fortnite was doing an event with Travis Scott (who is a famous American rapper). He was going to be performing a live concert in the video game that people were able to watch live in Fortnite.

I was interested in Twitter data that are geo-tagged in the United States, so I did not change the pre-set parameters.

From examining the map, the majority of the tweets are condensed in major cities across the United States. The East side of the country has considerably more tweets compared to the West side this is including Alaska and Hawaii. I attribute this to fewer large metropolitan cities in the Western US compared to the Eastern. The tweet locations seem to be more sporatic and spread out in the Eastern part of the US. This could be attributed that more people live in towns outside of the major cities/suburbs in Eastern US compared to Western US. If you examine along the Eastern/South Eastern coast there seems to be almost a line of tweets appearing. Unlike the West coast where there is less of a line of people tweeting along the coast. This could be because less people live on the West coast of America because of climate/topography compared to the Eastern/South Eastern US coastline.

Lastly, the distribution of the tweets could be because there is better wifi/internet connections on the Eastern side of the US because more people populate this area, so there is a higher demand for good wifi/internet connection. I bring this point up because to engage in the Fortnite and Travis Scott event on the game you need to have internet connection.
